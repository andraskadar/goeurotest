# iOS-Test


**Dev Environment**
* macOS Sierra - Version 10.12.6 (16G29)
* Xcode - Version 9.0 (9A235)
* CocoaPods - Version 1.3.1

**Used Pods**
* RealmSwift: Local database
* Moya: Network Abstraction Layer (over Alamofire)
* RxSwift: Reactive programming implementation for Swift

**Notes**

The task said, that I should use Objective-C with iOS 7 support, but I prefer Swift and the newer iOS versions (so I lived with the last note: "reduce the scope, if needed" :D ).
